Advanced Filtering in ASP.NET MVC with DevExtreme DataGrid

 This POC demonstrates advanced server-side filtering with DevExtreme DataGrid in an ASP.NET MVC application. It includes three distinct approaches to handle filtering 
 using additional parameters:

 Backend Params Filtering: Filters are applied entirely on the backend, providing centralized control and logic for data filtering.
 Dynamic Params Filtering: Filtering parameters are dynamically generated on the client side and passed to the server for processing.
 Static Params Filtering: Predefined, hardcoded filter parameters are sent directly to the backend.
 
 Each approach demonstrates how DevExtreme's DataGrid can be customized to fit different filtering needs in a structured and efficient way.
